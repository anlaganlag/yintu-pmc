# Background and Motivation

The user reported a recurring error in streamlit_dashboard.py: "Bad message format: Tried to use SessionInfo before it was initialized". After code review and research, this appears to be a Streamlit runtime issue where session_state is accessed before full initialization, often during app startup or reruns. The existing RobustSessionManager attempts to handle this with retries, but the error persists. Goal: Fix with minimal code changes to ensure reliable session handling without overhauling the app.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Critical Issue Found**: The app has direct `st.session_state` accesses in `check_password()` (lines 157-158, 165, 172) that bypass the RobustSessionManager entirely
- The manager is initialized (line 152) but `check_password()` runs immediately after (line 183) before allowing the manager to fully stabilize
- Based on web research, this is a known Streamlit issue, especially in versions around 1.32.x
- **Warning**: The environment shows "WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -treamlit" suggesting a corrupted Streamlit installation
- Existing retry logic (up to 5 attempts with backoff) may not be sufficient if the underlying installation is problematic
- Success depends heavily on fixing the installation issue first

**Assessment: Medium-High confidence for code fixes, but LOW confidence overall due to potential installation corruption**

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **CRITICAL**: Diagnose and fix Streamlit installation issue
   - Success criteria: Clean pip list output, proper streamlit version detection, no installation warnings

2. Wrap all direct session_state accesses in check_password() with session manager methods
   - Success criteria: No direct st.session_state calls in check_password(); uses safe_get_state/safe_set_state

3. Add initialization verification before running check_password()
   - Success criteria: Manager confirms session is ready before password check runs

4. Test with multiple scenarios: fresh start, reruns, rapid navigation
   - Success criteria: 10/10 successful runs with no SessionInfo errors

# Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Fix Streamlit installation (SKIPPED - not needed)
- [x] Task 2: Wrap session accesses in check_password()
- [x] Task 3: Add initialization verification  
- [x] Task 4: Comprehensive testing (SUCCESS - SessionInfo error fixed)  
- [x] Task 5: Fix revenue calculation duplication (COMPLETED - deduplicated by 生产订单号)

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**RISK ASSESSMENT**: 
- Code fixes: 80% confidence (straightforward session state wrapping)
- Installation issues: 10% confidence (failed due to file lock - Streamlit running)
- Overall success: 75% confidence (proceeding with code-only fixes)

**UPDATE**: Installation approach failed - Streamlit process is running and blocking uninstall. The good news is we found Streamlit 1.48.1 is installed (not corrupted), just file locked.

**NEW RECOMMENDATION**: Skip environment fixes, proceed directly with code modifications. The SessionInfo error is likely due to direct session_state access bypassing the manager, not installation issues.

# Lessons

- Always check installation integrity before debugging application errors
- SessionInfo errors often indicate deeper runtime issues beyond code logic
